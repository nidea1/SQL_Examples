# JOINS

A JOIN used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.


## Different Types of Joins

- **INNER JOIN:** Return records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN:** Return records of the left table and matching records in the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Return records of the right table and matching records in the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Return matching records of the left and the right table.
- **SELF JOIN:** A self join is a unique type of join where a table is joined with itself.
- **CROSS JOIN:** A cross join, also known as a Cartesian join, returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning each row from the first table is combined with each row from the second table.
