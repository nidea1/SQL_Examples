# Functions

One of the most powerful features of SQL is the ability to use functions to perform various operations on the data in a database.

## Different Types of SQL Functions
- **User Defined Functions:** These are functions that users create according to their own needs.
- **Built-In Functions:** They are functions that are defined within SQL itself and are widely used.
